# 🖥️ Mano Microprogrammed Computer Simulator

This is a GUI-based simulator for the microprogrammed control unit of a basic computer system, based on Chapter 7 of "Computer System Architecture" by M. Morris Mano. The simulator is implemented in Python with a Tkinter interface.

## 📘 Project Description

In this project, we simulate a microprogrammed control unit architecture. Users can input both a microprogram (control memory contents) and an assembly-like program (main memory instructions). The simulator interprets these inputs and visually displays memory content and register states at each clock cycle of execution.

This project was developed as part of a university course on **Computer Design and Architecture**.

## ✨ Features

- GUI interface using Tkinter.
- Text editors for microprogram and program input.
- Visualization of memory table and register contents.
- Microinstruction and assembly execution tracing.
- Reset and assemble functionality.
- Step-by-step simulation of instructions and control flow.

🧩 Components

- `main.py`: The main GUI application for the simulator.
- `MicroprogrammControl.py`: Backend logic for instruction decoding, execution, and register/memory control.
